# Technologies Used

This project is built using:

- ReactJS
- React Hooks
- Custom React Hooks Like `useForm` and `useInView`
- React Router V6
- Redux Toolkit
- Styled Components
- Framer motion
- NodeJS
- Express
- PostgreSQL

- Heroku

# Development Workflow

### Prerequisites:

To be able to run this application locally on your system, you'll need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) version 2.25 or higher
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14.2 or higher
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) version 14.5 or higher

### Steps to run this application locally:

1. Start by cloning the repository into your local file system.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SukhjinderArora/fullstack-ecommerce-app.git
   ```

2. CD in to the project directory

   ```bash
   cd fullstack-ecommerce-app
   ```

3. Open the repository in your favorite code editor.
4. Go into the `api` directory inside the project directory.
5. Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and set up all the environment variables mentioned in that file.
6. Now go into the `client` directory inside the project directory.
7. Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and set up all the environment variables mentioned in that file.
8. Optionally, you can restore the database from the `ecommerce.dump` file in the `database-backup` directory to get the sample list of products and categories loaded in the database. For example:

   ```bash
   pg_restore -d <database-name> ecommerce.dump -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U <database-user>
   ```

   **Note:** Replace the database-name and database-user with your database name and user.

9. `CD` into the `api` directory of the project and run the following command to start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
10. `CD` into the `client` directory of the project and run the following command to start the react app:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

# Deploying To Heroku

### Prerequisites:

To be able to deploy this app to Heroku, you'll need:

- An [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account
- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) installed on your system

### Steps to deploy this app on Heroku:

1. CD into the project's root directory.
2. Now login to Heroku by running the following command:

   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```

3. `CD` into the project's root directory and run:

   ```bash
   heroku create <application-name>
   ```

4. `CD` into the `client` directory of the project and run the following command to build the react application:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build-and-move
   ```

   This command builds the React application and moves the `build` directory from the `client` directory to the `api` directory and renames it to the `public` directory.

5. Now, `cd` into the project's root directory and run the following command to push the application to the remote Heroku repository:

   ```bash
   git subtree push --prefix api heroku main
   ```

   Because we only want to push the `api` directory to Heroku, this command will generate a new commit tree with the `api` directory as root, and push it to the remote Heroku repository.

6. Provision the PostgreSQL database in your application dashboard on Heroku website.

7. Optionally, you can restore the database from the `ecommerce.dump` file in the `database-backup` directory by running this command:

   ```bash
   heroku pg:backups:restore '<URL of upload location>' DATABASE_URL --app <your-heroku-app-name>
   ```

   **Note:** In order for PG Backups to access and import your dump file you will need to upload it somewhere with an HTTP-accessible URL.

8. Set up the environment variables in your application dashboard on Heroku.
9. You should now be able to access the application at `https://<application-name>.herokuapp.com/` in your browser.
